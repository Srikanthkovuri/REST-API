# REST-API
* As we all know REST-API is,
   * A **REST API (Representational State Transfer API)** is a type of **application programming interface (API)** that adheres to the principles of REST architecture.
   * **Uniform Interface**: REST APIs use a uniform interface 
      * typically HTTP
      * with standard methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. 
      * to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.   
**To create a REST-API applications using** 
   * **FASTAPI** framework in python
   * Need to install 'fastapi module',to install it type
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi[standard]
   ```
   * Need to install server 'uvicorn module' to host,for installing
   ```bash
   pip install uvicorn
   ```  
## hello.py
* create a file as <file-name.py>
* Now, define function which prints a message like as i did on **hello.py**
* For debugging, Run -> add configuration -> fastapi -> 'file-name.py' ->F5
* Now,upon successful execution, we will be able to see message on our browser
   * By requsting to the server where it is hosting
